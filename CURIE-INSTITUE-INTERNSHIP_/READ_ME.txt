In this folder you will find the different folders corresponding to the few models I had to do during my internship.

1 - In 1D_Diffusion_model you will find the codes that are related to the diffusion of a hromone in time and space.
Especially it is a 1D model where we compute the evolution of the concentration of a hormone that can be diffused in a worm.

2 - In Modelling lin4 regulation you will find the gene network model that corresponds to all the codes where I wanted to compute the evolution of the concentration of lin4 microRNA, lin14 mRNA and the LIN14 protein in time during all the larval stages of the development of the worm.
You will find inside different codes where some describe a simple model, some describe interactions between some species, some take into account the time dependance of the activator of the two genes of interest (lin4 and lin14) on which we build this model.

3 - In the PROCESSES I MADE folder there are different processes that are useful to follow before doing any code because it is related to the libraries to install on the computer to have the most prepared environment.
The Setup_Gitlab protocol describes how to upload a file or a folder on gitlab and is available on elab too.
Note: Gitlab is an online server where people of a team can upload there codes with the different versions at different timepoints and they can share the codes also).

4 - In the SHOWING_RESULTS folder you will find a few codes that I made and that pretend to be as generic as possible.
They are made for plotting multiples curves in colors we set in the begining and also to lay out the results we want to plot in python.
I used them in some of the codes in the 1D_Diffusion_model and also in the Modelling_lin4_regulation.

5 - In side projects there are codes that I saw, studied, modified a bit but that were not at the center of my work so might be further works for the other members of the team I guess.
